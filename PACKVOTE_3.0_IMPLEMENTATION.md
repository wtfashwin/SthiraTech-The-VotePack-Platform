# PackVote 3.0 - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Executive Summary

PackVote has been successfully upgraded from version 2.0 to **PackVote 3.0**, a market-leading unified group travel super-app with three defensible, high-impact features that position it as a potential $500K+ asset.

---

## üöÄ New Features Implemented

### 1. AI Consensus Engine (V1)
**Goal**: Help groups resolve conflicting preferences through intelligent scoring and proposal generation.

#### Backend Implementation:
- **File**: `packages/api/ai_consensus.py` (NEW)
  - `calculate_compatibility_score()`: Scores proposals (0-100) based on budget, vibe, and pace
  - `generate_proposal_variations()`: Creates 2-3 distinct itinerary proposals
  - `generate_consensus_proposals()`: Main endpoint function returning scored proposals

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/{trip_id}/consensus-proposals`
  - Returns top 3 scored proposals with justifications
  - Factors: Budget compatibility (40%), Vibe/Interest match (40%), Pace preference (20%)

- **Schemas** (in `schemas.py`):
  - `ConsensusProposal`: Individual proposal with score, activities, budget
  - `ConsensusProposalsResponse`: Full response with group stats

#### Frontend Implementation:
- **Component**: `packages/web/src/components/ConsensusProposalsCard.tsx` (NEW)
  - Beautiful gradient card with medal rankings (ü•áü•àü•â)
  - Visual score indicators with color coding
  - Pace badges and budget displays
  - "Discuss" and "Customize" action buttons

#### How It Works:
1. Analyzes participant survey responses (budget, vibe, dates)
2. Generates 3 proposal variations: Budget-Friendly, Balanced, Premium
3. Scores each proposal against group preferences
4. Displays ranked proposals with detailed justifications

---

### 2. Commitment & Escrow Flow (Stripe Integration - Test Mode)
**Goal**: Reduce trip dropouts through optional commitment deposits.

#### Backend Implementation:
- **Models** (in `models.py`):
  - `Participant.stripe_account_id`: For Stripe Connect payouts
  - `Trip.commitment_amount` & `commitment_currency`: Deposit requirements
  - `CommitmentDeposit`: Tracks deposit status per participant

- **Router**: `packages/api/routers/payments.py` (NEW)
  - `POST /api/v1/payments/participants/{id}/stripe-onboarding`: Generate Stripe Connect link
  - `POST /api/v1/payments/trips/{id}/commit`: Create payment intent for deposit
  - `POST /api/v1/payments/stripe/webhook`: Handle Stripe webhook events
  - `GET /api/v1/payments/trips/{id}/deposits`: Get all deposits for a trip

- **CRUD Functions** (in `crud.py`):
  - `create_commitment_deposit()`: Initialize deposit record
  - `update_deposit_status()`: Update status from Stripe events
  - `get_deposit_by_payment_intent()`: Retrieve deposit for webhooks
  - `update_participant_stripe_account()`: Link Stripe account to participant

#### Frontend Implementation:
- **Component**: `packages/web/src/components/CommitmentSection.tsx` (NEW)
  - Progress bar showing payment completion rate
  - Quick stats: Paid, Pending, Not Started
  - Expandable participant details with status badges
  - Educational info banner

- **Stripe Libraries Added**:
  - `@stripe/react-stripe-js`: React components for Stripe
  - `@stripe/stripe-js`: Core Stripe SDK

#### Configuration Required:
Add to `.env`:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

#### How It Works:
1. Trip creator sets optional commitment amount
2. Participants click "Pay Deposit" to create payment intent
3. Stripe Payment Element handles secure card input (V2 implementation)
4. Webhooks update deposit status in real-time
5. Dashboard shows live payment progress

---

### 3. Creator-to-Booking Pipeline (Social Media Import)
**Goal**: Allow users to paste social media URLs to generate itinerary suggestions.

#### Backend Implementation:
- **Service**: `packages/api/scraping_service.py` (NEW)
  - `detect_platform()`: Identifies TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, etc.
  - `extract_text_from_url()`: Scrapes content using BeautifulSoup
  - `extract_activities_with_ai()`: Uses Gemini AI to parse activities from text
  - `import_activities_from_url()`: Main function returning suggestions

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/itinerary/trips/{id}/import-from-url`
  - Accepts URL in request body
  - Returns suggested activities with confidence scores

- **Schemas** (in `schemas.py`):
  - `ImportFromUrlRequest`: URL input
  - `ImportedActivitySuggestion`: Activity with title, notes, location, confidence
  - `ImportFromUrlResponse`: Full response with platform detection

#### Frontend Implementation:
- **Component**: `packages/web/src/components/ImportFromUrlModal.tsx` (NEW)
  - URL input form with validation
  - AI-powered activity extraction display
  - Confidence score indicators
  - Multi-select interface for adding to itinerary
  - Platform detection (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, etc.)

#### Dependencies Added:
- Backend: `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`
- Uses existing `google-generativeai` for AI parsing

#### How It Works:
1. User pastes social media URL (TikTok, Instagram, etc.)
2. Backend scrapes page content
3. Gemini AI extracts structured activities
4. Frontend displays suggestions with confidence scores
5. User selects activities to add to trip itinerary
